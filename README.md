# carSpd

The carSpd (name in progress) is a work in progress device used to display your car's speed and other data in an easy to read, digital format. To do this, the device takes advantage of your car's speed and injector signals, much like the [MPGuino](http://ecomodder.com/wiki/index.php/MPGuino) project. Planned features include imperial/metric support, gas mileage and time display, and probably more depending on feature creep.

My main motivation for starting this project is so that I wont have to read the tiny kph numbers on my car's speedometer, since I just moved to Canada from the US with my car. 

*This project is meant to be some kind of successor to the canceled carbt_v1 project. While their main functions are very different, they both serve the purpose of improving or adding new functions to my car.*
